- __Git__ Using Git and github.
- __Code Style__ Using CSS.
- __Visual Design__ Use Flexbox, CSS Grid, Bootstrap.
- __Heroku__ [Heroku link](https://fast-beach-84181.herokuapp.com/).

## Work flows
1)
https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/webide-github-merge-pull-request.html
create basic file structure

2)
npm install bcrypt --save
npm install body-parser --save
npm install express --save
npm install jws --save
npm install mongoose --save

3)
added front end
landing.html
stockTracker.html
landing.css
stockTracker.css
normalize.css

4)
https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
installed dotenv.
when need hide variable that this web site need such as access token and should not upload to github,
we will use heroku enviornment variable tool to store our hiden variable.
we then add those hidden variables to gitignore file, so not to upload them.

5)
app.js boilerplate
server.js boilerplate (with landing page html endpoint)

6)
stockTracker.html added layout style

7)
app.js add landing page buttons function show signup/login form

8)
app.js add tracker page button function add new trade log as array

9)
app.js refactor tracker page button function add new trade log as a function

10)
review the web development CURD flow

https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1rclTondYQLozH8-VZWBEJfDUXLQz3VGx5ZCOQFEZ4dg/edit

11)
the 2 stock market api
https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED&symbol=AAPL&apikey=CUGQ1VDKVRZ77B9U
https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/aapl/chart/5y

12)
app.js, begin pair program.
the goal here is to get form data, ajax get request stock api, filter the response json data, format the data to store in log.
when add new trade info to log, use the form's stock symbol and date as filtering criteria for ajax request.
ajax request from stock data for 5 to 20 years (depends on which api).

13)
ajax get request stock app for stock data,
filter response json data.

14)
jquery string litteral of data to stocktracker page, as log.

15)
signup button creates user in database.
user bcrypt to hash password, then store into database.

16)
login button fetch user from database and redirect to tracker page.
signup and login button add json web token and checks verify on page refresh.

17)
one user to many trade database reference. trade model find one user with thte same user id.
just display logs belongs to that userwho singed in.

18) 
Heroku lessons learned:
- must include [ mongoose.connect( process.env.MONGODB_URI || "mongodb://localhost/stock-tracker10",  { useMongoClient: true }); ] inside the models index.js
- heroku only takes master branch
- must include Procfile containing "web: node server.js" (replace server.js with wherever your project begins)
- env variable needs to be implemented into heroku app

19) 
edited the user model to include a property for the user's image url
- added a input field in the sign up form for the image url
- edit the placeholder for the image in the html file to include an id to which add the source url
- ajax + server req/res for the image url in database
- use ajax to push image url into string literal and make the image source the user's url from database

20) 
- npm install dotenv module (for env)
- touch new file ".env" in root directory
- set up env file to include the token's secret key
- git ignore .env file in order to hide from git along with other node modules
- replace all instances of the secret key in the server.js file with the process.env.VARIABLENAME method

### git tutorial
As a team member work on 1 branch as a collaborater, initialy create a project repo on github, each member will clone to their own local branch, after is ready to upload, check if I am behind master, then I pull from master, else upload to own branch first, pull request master branch
1) create a github remote repo
2) on github create 2 branches
3) clone the master to local
4) create local branch to match the name of remote branch, and work on that branch
5) do something
6) from my local branch, add, commit, 
7) fetch origin master / go to github to see if behind, to check if master more up to date me me
8) pull origin master
9) push to origin my branch name
10) go to github, click to crate pull request, click merge 2 times
11) back to terminal, swithch to local mater branch
12) pull origin master
13) swithc to my local branch
14) fetch origin master
15) pull origin master
16) push origin YI
17) for changes that not stage and you want to remove use git stash or git checkout -- filename or git reset --hard
